# EE-208-Control-Engineering


The course of Control Engineering expected us to research and find solutions to various mini-projects using MATLAB. This repository contains the problem statements, codes, simulations and our research on the given problem statements.

## Problem Statement

Each problem statement was unique on its own and had several twists from normal approach. We read research papers related to the key points of PS from various sources like Arxiv, IEEE, Research Gate and Google Scholar.

## Code And Simulations

We used MATLAB R2021b to code our MATLAB scripts and Simulink to test our results. Few frequently used blocks were
